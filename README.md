## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

How to make a page responsive using HTML and CSS

Here is a simple example of the code:

```
.page{
  background-color: #ffffff;
  width: 250px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  margin: -200px 0 0 -120px;
  padding: 8px 0px 10px 10px;
   border-radius: 13px;
}
```

### Continued development

Can't use percentage(%) for the measurement of width when you want to make the page reponsive
